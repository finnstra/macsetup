# CONTRIBUTING

This project is mostly to help me improve my bash skills and learn how to automate outside
of Windows environments. However, I'm open to contributions and pull requests.

## Submitting Pull Requests

* Requests should be pulled against the `master` branch.
* macsetup only supports the latest stable release of macOS, unless stated otherwise. Bugs in previous or beta of macOS are unsupported.
* Currently I don't follow any particular style guide. Your code should be readable, above all else.
* Be nice :)

### Availability

This is a side-project, which means my availability is somewhat-limited. I expected to review your
pull requests within 1-3 days, but my work projects and schedules may delay this. Feel free to reach
out on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com//@finnstra) @finnstra if you have questions.

### Unit Testing

This project does not perform any unit testing (and it probably should). Feel free to contribute some tests
if you are interested.

That's it, really.
